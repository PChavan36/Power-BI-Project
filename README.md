# Climate Change and Agriculture - Power BI 
Climate Change and Agriculture
The dashboard offers actionable insights into the interplay between climate change and agricultural performance, highlighting key metrics like precipitation, soil health, and crop yield trends. By enabling stakeholders to visualize economic impacts, extreme weather events, and future forecasts, this project facilitates data-driven decision-making for agricultural sustainability.

Process:
• Data Collection: Sourced raw datasets from Kaggle.
• Data Cleaning and Organization: Processed and transformed data using Excel Power Query.
• Database Management: Created and managed relational databases in MySQL with tables for climate and agricultural data.
• Data Visualization: Built the final dashboard in Power BI with advanced forecasting and analysis.

Key Dashboard Insights:
✅ KPIs Panel: High-level metrics like Economic Impact, Crop Yield, Total precipitation, irrigation access, and soil health index.
✅ Temperature vs. Crop Yield: Explored the correlation between climate patterns and crop yields over time.
✅ Extreme Weather Impact: Assessed how various crop types respond to extreme events through interactive visuals.
✅ Crop Yield Forecast: Projected future crop yields to support agricultural planning.
✅ Economic Impact Analysis: Modelled the financial impact of climate change on various crops.
✅ Soil Health Map: Provided global insights into soil health indices, enabling geographic comparisons.

By leveraging Power BI’s advanced features like slicers, interactive visuals, and forecasting, this project highlights how data storytelling can drive real-world agricultural solutions.
